**Jotai** offers superior integration with React's Suspense compared to **Zustand**, primarily due to its design and built-in features that align closely with Suspense's capabilities. Here's how Jotai excels in this area:

### **1. Built-in Support for Asynchronous State**

- **Asynchronous Atoms**: Jotai allows you to create atoms that can handle asynchronous operations directly. These atoms can return promises, which integrate seamlessly with React Suspense.
  
  ```javascript
  import { atom } from 'jotai';

  const asyncDataAtom = atom(async () => {
    const response = await fetch('/api/data');
    return response.json();
  });
  ```

- **Suspension Handling**: When an asynchronous atom is read, Jotai will automatically suspend the component until the promise resolves. This leverages React Suspense to show fallback UI during data fetching.

### **2. Fine-Grained Control Over State Dependencies**

- **Composable Atoms**: Jotai's atoms can depend on other atoms, including asynchronous ones. This composability allows for complex state management patterns that still work seamlessly with Suspense.
  
  ```javascript
  const derivedAtom = atom((get) => {
    const data = get(asyncDataAtom);
    // Perform computations with the fetched data
    return processData(data);
  });
  ```

- **Selective Suspense**: Since atoms are consumed individually, only the components that rely on a suspending atom will be affected, allowing for more granular loading states.

### **3. Ease of Integration with React Suspense**

- **No Extra Boilerplate**: Jotai doesn't require additional libraries or complex setup to work with Suspense. The integration is straightforward and out-of-the-box.

- **Concurrent Features Ready**: Jotai is designed with React's concurrent features in mind, making it future-proof as React continues to evolve.

### **4. Zustand's Limitations with Suspense**

- **Lack of Native Support**: Zustand doesn't have built-in mechanisms to handle asynchronous state that integrates with React Suspense.

- **Manual Workarounds Needed**: Implementing Suspense with Zustand often requires additional code or third-party libraries to bridge the gap, increasing complexity.

  - You might need to manage loading states manually or use React's `useTransition` hook, which can add to the boilerplate.

- **Global vs. Local State**: Zustand is optimized for global state management, and integrating Suspense for local, asynchronous data fetching is less straightforward.

### **5. Improved Developer Experience with Jotai**

- **Simplicity**: Jotai's API is minimalistic and intuitive, reducing the learning curve when working with asynchronous operations and Suspense.

- **TypeScript Support**: Strong TypeScript integration ensures type safety when dealing with asynchronous atoms, which is beneficial for large, complex applications.

- **Code Reusability**: Atoms being plain JavaScript functions and objects can be easily shared between frontend and backend, aligning with your goal of reusing computed state getters.

### **6. Practical Example**

Consider a component that needs to fetch user data:

**With Jotai:**

```javascript
// atoms.js
import { atom } from 'jotai';

export const userAtom = atom(async () => {
  const response = await fetch('/api/user');
  return response.json();
});

// UserComponent.jsx
import { useAtom } from 'jotai';
import { userAtom } from './atoms';

function UserComponent() {
  const [user] = useAtom(userAtom);
  return <div>{user.name}</div>;
}

// App.jsx
import React, { Suspense } from 'react';
import UserComponent from './UserComponent';

function App() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
      <UserComponent />
    </Suspense>
  );
}
```

**With Zustand (Additional Complexity):**

Zustand doesn't support Suspense natively, so you'd need to handle loading states manually:

```javascript
// store.js
import create from 'zustand';

export const useStore = create((set) => ({
  user: null,
  fetchUser: async () => {
    const response = await fetch('/api/user');
    const data = await response.json();
    set({ user: data });
  },
}));

// UserComponent.jsx
import { useEffect } from 'react';
import { useStore } from './store';

function UserComponent() {
  const { user, fetchUser } = useStore();
  
  useEffect(() => {
    if (!user) {
      fetchUser();
    }
  }, [user, fetchUser]);

  if (!user) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>; // Manual loading state
  }

  return <div>{user.name}</div>;
}
```

### **7. Future-Proofing Your Application**

- **React 18 and Beyond**: With React 18's emphasis on concurrent features and Suspense, using a state manager that aligns with these concepts ensures better compatibility and easier upgrades.

- **Performance Optimizations**: Jotai's approach can lead to better performance due to reduced unnecessary re-renders and more efficient state updates.

### **Conclusion**

**Jotai** is better suited for applications that intend to leverage React Suspense due to its native support for asynchronous atoms, seamless integration with Suspense, and finer control over state dependencies. It simplifies the handling of asynchronous data, reduces boilerplate code, and aligns closely with modern React features, making it an excellent choice for your complex TypeScript React application.

### **Recommendations**

- **Try Out Jotai**: Implement a sample feature using Jotai to experience its integration with Suspense firsthand.

- **Leverage Documentation**: Utilize Jotai's comprehensive documentation and examples related to Suspense and asynchronous atoms.

- **Community Resources**: Engage with the Jotai community for best practices and advanced patterns that can help optimize your application.
